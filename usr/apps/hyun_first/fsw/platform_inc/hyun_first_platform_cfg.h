**  Purpose:
**    Define platform configurations for the Hyun_first application

**  Notes:
**   1. This file was automatically generated by cFS Basecamp's app

**      a new app with the same name is created. 
**   2. Compile-time configurations that are applied to each platform
**      deployment of this app.
**   3. These definitions should minimal and only contain parameters that
**      need to be configurable at compile time that allows users to tuned
**      the app for a particular platform. Use hyun_first_mission_cfg.h
**      for compile-time parameters that need to be tuned at the mission
**      level across all platform deployments. Use app_cfg.h for compile-time
**      parameters that don't need to be configured when an app is deployed
**      but are useful to be parameterized for maintaining the app and use
**      the JSON initialization file for parameters that can be defined at
**      runtime.
